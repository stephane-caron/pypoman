def intersect_line_polygon(line, vertices, apply_hull):
    """
    Intersect a line segment with a polygon.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line : couple of arrays
        End points of the line segment (2D or 3D).
    vertices : list of arrays
        Vertices of the polygon.
    apply_hull : bool
        Set to `True` to apply a convex hull algorithm to `vertices`.
        Otherwise, the function assumes that vertices are already sorted in
        clockwise or counterclockwise order.

    Returns
    -------
    inter_points : list of array
        List of intersection points between the line segment and the polygon.
